# manganato-cli

## Description
This project is a simple tool to read manga from the website [manganato.com](manganato.com) using it's API. Instead of going to the website, look for the manga, remember the chapter you were... etc. this CLI will make this process easier for you by keeping track of the chapters automatically, which mangas have you read, if you start reading new ones they'll be remembered automatically.
